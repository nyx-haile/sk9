Did some work in the shed today.

Was planning to print the old models in the ultimaker (since they were too large for our X1s). Turns out they were too large for that too, and I realised I was being a bit wasteful with the design. The new version is designed to be placed onto a wooden plank or similar hard surface, and then clamped that way. I'll put a batch in the printer before I go and report the progress tomorrow.
