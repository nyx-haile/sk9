Print updates:

The weight of each mold module came out to be a bit higher than I'd hoped, at around 1.2 kg. Due to this, and some conversation with Anhad (anhadsawhney.com) I tried significantly lower infills (original module was at 15%, reduced to 5%). The new module had shearing issues with the outer wall, which I believe are probably due to lack of internal support and warping due to cooling. Another friend of mine, Hannah Gazdus (), suggested that I route the moulds, a solution which I'd shied away from due to lack of supplies. Considering the printing costs this is coming out to, I might have no choice. 

Upon further inspection I noticed that even the original models had some warping in the corners which would make it difficult to use them with the original clamping mechanism.

Also, due to realisations that my original plans to embed strain gauges inside the laminated pieces will almost certainly cause shearing due to lack of contact with the adhesive, so I'm going to scrap that idea before it causes a large incident. Instead, I think I'll make a miniature version of the main design.
